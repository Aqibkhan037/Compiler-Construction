Introduction to the C# Regex Library
The .NET framework provides a powerful library for working with regular expressions in C# through the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace. Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, are patterns used to match and manipulate text. The C# Regex class allows you to define these patterns and perform various operations like searching for matches, extracting data, and replacing text based on these patterns. Below, we'll delve into the functioning of the C# Regex library with detailed explanations and examples.
Creating a Regex Object
A Regex object is your entry point into using regular expressions in C#. To create one, you define a regex pattern and compile it using the Regex class.

Csharp code:
using System.Text.RegularExpressions; string pattern = @"\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"; Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);

In this example, we've created a Regex object to match the pattern for a social security number.
Matching with the Match Method
You can use the Match method to find the first occurrence of the regex pattern in an input string.

csharp code:
string input = "My social security number is 123-45-6789."; Match match = regex.Match(input); if (match.Success) { Console.WriteLine("Match found: " + match.Value); } 

Here, we search for the pattern within the input string and, if a match is found, we retrieve and print the matched text.
Matching All Occurrences with the Matches Method
To find all occurrences of a pattern in an input string, you can use the Matches method.

Csharp code:
string input = "Phone numbers: 123-456-7890 and 987-654-3210."; MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(input); foreach (Match match in matches) { Console.WriteLine("Match found: " + match.Value); } 

The Matches method returns a collection of all matches found in the input string, which you can iterate through to access each match.
Replacing with the Replace Method
The Regex.Replace method allows you to replace all occurrences of a pattern in an input string with a specified replacement.

csharp code:
string input = "Hello, my email is user@example.com."; string replacement = "REDACTED"; string result = regex.Replace(input, replacement); Console.WriteLine("Modified input: " + result); 

In this example, any matches of the regex pattern in the input string are replaced with the REDACTED text, producing the modified string.

Common Regex Patterns and Elements
Regular expressions consist of various elements that define patterns for matching text. Here are common elements:
Literals
Match literal characters directly, e.g., abc matches the string "abc."
Character Classes
Match any character from a set, e.g., [aeiou] matches any vowel.
Quantifiers
Specify how many times a character or group should appear, e.g., \d{3} matches exactly three digits.
Anchors
Indicate where the match should occur within the input string:
•	^ matches the start of a string.
•	$ matches the end of a string.
•	\b matches word boundaries.
Escaping Special Characters
To match special characters like . or * as literals, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., \. matches a period.
Alternation
Use the | symbol to specify alternatives, e.g., cat|dog matches either "cat" or "dog."
Grouping
Parentheses create groups, allowing you to apply quantifiers to multiple characters, e.g., (abc)+ matches one or more repetitions of "abc."
Character Escapes
Backslashes followed by special characters match specific character types, e.g., \d matches digits, \s matches whitespace, and \w matches word characters.
Regular expressions can be simple or complex, depending on your specific needs. Complex patterns may require practice, but they are incredibly powerful for text processing and pattern matching tasks in C#.
